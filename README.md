#### Project Overview Version 1.0.1:

// TODO:
// implement controls to move up and down ✓
// create space boundary so user can't go too far out
// make it so that user can't go through planets
// make saturn's rings look good
// implement controls for user to move faster if desired
// translit orbit data into actual orbits ✓
// make smooth animations for the orbits ✓
// make orbit controls not mess up the keyboard controls ✓
// make orbit rings
// dynamically space planets
// make main not ugly

requirements:
- super 3d
- live rotation (at set speeds, x2, x4, x8, etc.)
- type in the date and then the planets position's shift to that date

possibilities:
- pov from anywhere in the solar system
- asteroid belt
- has near earth asteroids
- has near earth comets
- has potentially hazardous asteroids
- information about the planets if zoomed in

minimum viable product:
- working orrery web that spins, has all the planets and the sun
- is live, with fast orbits

tech stack:
- typescript (front end)
    - three.js
- simple back-end (github pages)

data:
- keplerian paramaters
- nasa planet textures
